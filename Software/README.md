# Readme for the Software implementation

Architecture, updates, and ideas will be stored in this folder. 

## MicroPython

The micropython folder holds the needed .uf2 file to run any micropython on the RPI. We will shy away from using micropython unless we need to. 

## CircuitPython

CircuitPython is an adaption of MicroPython, but has built in libraries that Adafruit has designed and made open source. This makes testing their devboards very easy! Check out the CircuitPython directory README.me for more instructions.
