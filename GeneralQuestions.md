Should we add a Barameter to the design for more accurate elevation estimation. we could use the https://www.adafruit.com/product/1893?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqP2pBhDMARIsAJQ0Czp84QtlH3E43St_8XXffguFeP8QvQmYzIcJT_SQqniGbqEvoznyJMQaArhvEALw_wcB
which uses I2C which should make it no issue for the RP2040 to run.
Or possibly a range finder for more accurate measurements such as https://www.adafruit.com/product/5425?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqP2pBhDMARIsAJQ0Czo-TvVZGLSqTKRKi9_HX87qxiXsWxPQXMN79Z1jHOIFOVmlbkmSwuoaAu3yEALw_wcB
